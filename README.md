- ## Goal of Model
     - Build an ‘enriched’ customer profile by deriving “intelligent” KPIs depending on indepedent variable
     - Apply a data reduction technique factor analysis for variable reduction technique and a clustering algorithm  to reveal the behavioral segments of credit card holders
     - Identify cluster characteristics of the cluster using detailed profiling
     - Provide the strategic insights and implementation of strategies for given set of cluster characteristics
## Tools and package used in this project:
